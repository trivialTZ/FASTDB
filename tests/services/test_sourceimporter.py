# **********************************************************************
# Yikes, OK.  pytest raises all kinds of issues.
#
# Background: the tests in alertcycle.py are module-scope tests because
# they're slow.  They're used in test modules other than this one, so I
# can't just put them in this file.
#
# Tests in this file are ordered so that all the ones that need the *60days*
# fixtures not to have run yet happen above this point.  This class depends
# on the *60days* fixture not yet having run (it will run it part way
# through), so all other tests that include the *60days* fixtures must be
# below this class.
#
# But... now we have the problem that we want to do two tests, one before
# *60days* one after, but with a fixtures that's run before the first test,
# persists through the second tests, but then cleans up before any further
# tests after the next two tests.  The only way to do that is to introduce
# another scope and put those two tests in a class.  Which is a weird reason
# to use a class, but whatevs.  (The other way would have been to put these
# two tests in their own module, but that would mean overall evaluting the
# alertcycle.py tests yet another time.)  (And, of course, we could just use
# no module-scope fixtures, but that would be *really* slow, adding >30s for
# every test in this file.)
